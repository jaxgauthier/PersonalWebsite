# Personal Website

This is my first personal project I have iterated over time with additions to keep adding onto and improving over time. It is used to show my journey over my years of experiencing while highlighting my favorite projects 

## Contents

Page has two seperate routes, one for a general timeline that shows the key events over time leading me to where I am and the projects along the way. More indepth explanations on the projects are on the project page that show videos and skills covered by those projects. There is also a content page at the bottom with details on how to reach out 

### Functioning Code

The code is seperated into assets, components, and the styling for the pages. Assets hold all of the images and videos on the site. framer-motion is used for the animations on the page. The components hold all of the pages that are not the main header at the top of the page. That is help in the main directory under App.tsx. Thetimeline item has its own .tsx file to control its over all setup for easily implementation into the Home.tsx.
